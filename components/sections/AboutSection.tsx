                My Journey
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                I have been fortunate enough to spend about eight years working
                in the development sector with a range of technologies and
                people. Every experience adds to my skill set, but I am
                confident that I will continuously work hard at being as good as
                I can be at being a professional.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                In recent years working in e-commerce has given me extremely
                useful insights into how the industry operates. I have had a
                well-rounded experience in e-commerce, which has given me a good
                understanding of what e-commerce is.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                My education was in Information Systems and I specialize in
                Frontend. I am a technical developer able to leverage core web
                technologies like JavaScript, HTML and CSS and am skilled with
                frameworks/libraries like React and Vue. Technical ability is
                one of my strengths as a developer.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                I have every intention to continue to develop myself and embrace
                my enthusiasm for technology. I am excited to explore new
                technologies. I get joy out of learning and I aspire to use the
                knowledge I have gained over the years to provide as much value
                to society as I can possibly provide. My goal is to fulfil what
                is asked of me but also provide meaning to my work and
                contribute to society.
