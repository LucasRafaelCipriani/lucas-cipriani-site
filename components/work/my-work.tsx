        Since I was in the dynamic industry of Information Technology, working
        at McFadyen Digital, I was working mainly on the front-end development
        for e-commerce applications. This role allowed me to develop user
        interfaces to present and maintain a particular user experience for a
        range of online stores. Not only did they look great, but they also
        worked, and were user-friendly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Utilizing the full library of Front-End technologies: JavaScript, CSS,
        HTML and React, to bring the designs to life, I also gained experience
        with e-commerce technologies. Through the development work I did on
        e-commerce applications, I learned how to build a solid, scalable online
        store working with Ecommerce technologies such as consistently using and
        integrating with Magento2.

        A project that I was able to demonstrate my skills and the contributions
        I could make was with ABB Brasil. During my time at McFadyen Digital on
        this Magento2 project I was able to develop many screens and
        functionalities that were critical paths to success. This project was a
        great way to show I can tackle many large complex problems and deliver
        high-quality solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Not only did I aim to successfully deliver results during my time at
        McFadyen Digital, but I also focused on ensuring client satisfaction
        through all the development work I contributed. This dedication and
        commitment to excellence led to successful project outcomes, while I
        continuously pushed myself to improve and further develop my skill set
        to the best of my ability.
