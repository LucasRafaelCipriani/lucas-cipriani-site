      <p className="mt-[20px] text-[16px]">
        I have been fortunate enough to spend about eight years working in the
        development sector with a range of technologies and people. Every
        experience adds to my skill set, but I am confident that I will
        continuously work hard at being as good as I can be at being a
        professional. In recent years working in e-commerce has given me
        extremely useful insights into how the industry operates. I have had a
        well-rounded experience in e-commerce, which has given me a good
        understanding of what e-commerce is.
        <br />
        <br />
        My education was in Information Systems and I specialize in Front End. I
        am a technical developer able to leverage core web technologies like
        JavaScript, HTML and CSS and am skilled with frameworks/libraries like
        React and Vue. Technical ability is one of my strengths as a developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have every intention to continue to develop myself and embrace my
        enthusiasm for technology. I am excited to explore new technologies. I
        get joy out of learning and I aspire to use the knowledge I have gained
        over the years to provide as much value to society as I can possibly
        provide. My goal is to fulfil what is asked of me but also provide
        meaning to my work and contribute to society.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is what I mean by seeking constant growth and contributing - that
        is a part of who I am, both personally and professionally in the space
        that I work.
