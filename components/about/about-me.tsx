      <h2 className="text-[30px] font-bold">About Me</h2>
      <p className="mt-[20px] text-[16px]">
        With nearly six years of experience in the development sector, I've had
        the privilege of engaging with a diverse array of technologies and
        colleagues. These interactions have not only honed my skills but also
        inspired me to excel as a professional. My journey has been enriched by
        an in-depth understanding of the e-commerce landscape, offering me a
        comprehensive view of its workings.
        <br />
        <br /> Holding a degree in Information Systems, my expertise primarily
        lies in Front End development. I am proficient in utilizing core web
        technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, alongside mastering
        frameworks like React and Vue. This technical proficiency is the
        cornerstone of my development capabilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        My passion for technology extends beyond my current skill set; I am
        fervently interested in exploring new technologies. I dedicate myself to
        continuous learning, aiming to absorb and apply the wealth of knowledge
        I've accumulated over the years. My goal is to not only meet the
        requirements set before me but to significantly contribute value to
        society through my work.
        <br />
        <br /> This drive for constant growth and contribution is what defines
        me both as a professional and an individual committed to making a
        difference in the tech world.
